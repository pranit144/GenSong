## Animation and Transition Enhancements

To add animations and transitions to the app:

### CSS for Animations
Add this CSS block to the Streamlit app for smooth transitions and hover effects:

```css
<style>
    body {
        animation: fadeIn 2s;
    }

    @keyframes fadeIn {
        from { opacity: 0; }
        to { opacity: 1; }
    }

    .stButton>button {
        transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
    }

    .stButton>button:hover {
        background-color: #007bb5;
        transform: scale(1.05);
    }
</style>
```

## Model Details

- **Model**: [sander-wood/text-to-music](https://huggingface.co/sander-wood/text-to-music)
- **Tokenization**: Utilizes `AutoTokenizer` for preparing text input.
- **Generation**: Uses beam search sampling to generate diverse musical outputs.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: The description is tokenized using the Hugging Face `AutoTokenizer`.
2. **Music Generation**: The model generates ABC notation from the input tokens.
3. **Output Rendering**: The generated notation is displayed and editable in the ABCJS editor.
